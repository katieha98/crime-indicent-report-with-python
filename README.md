### Project Overview
Keeping American public safe is the top priority for governments and all residents in the USA. Based on FBI crime data, Boston is not one of the safest communities in America. In 2017, Boston’s crime rate is 54% higher than the Massachusetts average. On top of that, looking at the violent crimes specifically, Boston has a violent crime rate that is 87% higher than the Massachusetts average and 75% higher than the national average.

In addition, gun control has always been a controversial debate in the US. Gun rights vs Gun control: which one is more reasonable? This triggers us to consult if there’s any method we can think of to reduce the violent offenses that related to gun use in Boston. The analysis is focus on telling a story about Boston's violent crimes from the year 2015 to date based on Boston Public Crime data.
Besides, we also build up a model to predict the shooting probability so that whenever Boston Polices encounter a lawbreaking event, they are well prepared to prevent more serious crimes that involves with gun use.
